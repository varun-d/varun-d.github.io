My journey began with an appreciation for words. <em>Stories</em> captivated my imagination, weaving ideas, thoughts and emotions into comqpelling narratives. My curiosity asks "...and then what happened!?".

Though <em>stories</em> don't exist in a vacuum. Language conveys ideas. Ideas take form through <em>design</em>. Awakened through visuals. Affording us an experience with shape, space, color and light.

<em>Design</em> gives us the blueprint. The art of engineering takes over. Solving problems, delighting us on the way. When <em>good enoguh</em> is enough. it is sustainable, ethical, timeless.

Story + Design + Technology
