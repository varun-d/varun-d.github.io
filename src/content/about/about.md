My journey began with an appreciation for words. <em>Stories</em> captivated my imagination. Weaving ideas, thoughts and emotions into compelling narratives.

<em>Stories</em> convey ideas. Ideas take form through <em>design</em>.

Awakened through visuals. Affording us an experience with shape, space, color and light. <em>Design</em> gives us the blueprint to create.

Now I've understood the <em>story</em>, and given it form through <em>design</em>.

<em>Technology</em> and engineering brings it to life. When done right it delights us.

Story + Design + Technology
